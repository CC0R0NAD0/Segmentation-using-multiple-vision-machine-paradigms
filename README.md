# Segmentation-using-multiple-vision-machine-paradigms
The detection of shapes and color typical of the paradigms of computer vision systems is used.

This project is implemented with Python in Google Colab, by Carlos Coronado Zúñiga and Adrián Monge Barahona, Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Costa Rica.


Given an image, three segmentations are developed:

- Segmentation 1: each of the squares must be segmented differently

- Segmentation 2: the red triangle must be segmented

- Segmentation 3: you have to segment the green objects


And for each segmentation you have to consider 2 different options
